# Archived Documentation

This directory contains documentation files that were part of the development process but are not actively maintained:

- **BACKEND_REVIEW.md** - Code review notes from development phase
- **SECURITY_FIXES_SUMMARY.md** - Security audit findings and remediation notes  
- **VIDEO_DEMO_SCRIPT.md** - Demo presentation script for project showcase
- **CBOE_INTERVIEW_ASSESSMENT.md** - Assessment documentation and requirements

These files are preserved for historical reference and context about the development process. They were moved here as part of repository cleanup to maintain a clean root directory while preserving important development history.

For current project documentation, see the main README.md in the repository root.
